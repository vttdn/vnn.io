	<h1>Vincent Tantardini, product designer</h1>
<p>
Curiosity has always been my compass. Whether in design, development, or documentation, I’m drawn to the in-between spaces—where technology meets craft, and where ideas begin to take form. My journey has spanned digital product design, front-end engineering, and photography, with each discipline informing the next. I’m interested in tools that don’t just work, but resonate. Tools that feel like extensions of the way we think, create, and observe the world.

In recent years, I’ve focused much of my energy on building <a href="https://withframes.com/">Frames</a>, a thoughtfully crafted app for film photographers to log, organize, and reflect on their analog shooting process. What started as a personal need became a full-featured ecosystem for photographers who still shoot on celluloid but live in a digital world. Frames is a notebook for the modern film shooter, combining metadata capture, geotagging, image attachment, and export options—all designed with the tactile, deliberate nature of analog photography in mind.

This site is both a portfolio and a playground. It’s a quiet space where I collect thoughts, archive experiments, and share the tools I wish existed. I believe in software that disappears into the background, interfaces that reward attention, and products that age gracefully. Whether you're here to collaborate, explore, or just pass through—welcome. Let’s make something honest.
